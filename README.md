#Automated Login Attempt Script using Selenium
Overview
This Python script automates login attempts on a website using the Selenium WebDriver. It systematically tries different username-password combinations by appending a range of numbers (from 1950 to 2000. You can change it.) to a base username.
To run this script, you need to install Selenium and have a compatible WebDriver

pip install selenium

How the Script Works
Opens Firefox and navigates to https://www.example.com.
Finds the username and password input fields.
Iterates through a list of possible credentials (e.g., example1950, example1951, ..., example2000).
Enters the credentials and clicks the login button.
Waits briefly before trying the next attempt.
Usage
Modify the script to use actual element IDs or class names from the target website.
Ensure you have permission to test automated login attempts to avoid violating any Terms of Service.
